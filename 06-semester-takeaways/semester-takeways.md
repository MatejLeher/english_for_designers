## Five Things I Learned This Semester

1. Content first
2. Always work on me, my work, and be able to present myself better.
3. Do not be afraid to make mistakes.
4. I don't have to be ashamed to use helper applications. Copying is something that can help us be better.
5. Now I know that most companies have their voice and tone. And how important it is.
