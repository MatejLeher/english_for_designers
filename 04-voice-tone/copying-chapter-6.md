Copying can help newcomers become better designers. When I was little, I enjoyed watching graphic design. 
I tried to look at the work of others. My first graphic project was web graphics and the web itself. 
As a team leader in the tourist section, I needed to bring together members outside the clubhouse. 
Give them private and secret information :no_mouth:. Owning a private site seemed like a clear solution.
At the age of 13, I had no experience with web programming or web graphics. There was nothing left but to search the online world and see how others were doing it.

My inspiration was graphics taken from our tourist section workshop website. I adapted all colors and pictograms for my needs. So, I copied someone's previous work, which was accepted at my age and for the specific purposes of the site. For me, it meant a start in many ways. I had to learn in graphics programs, understand and test myself how to achieve the final form. At that time, there were few online tutorials from which I could copy procedures, and I had to figure out most things on my own. I also had to learn basic programming techniques. For these purposes, I visited the website https://www.jakpsatweb.cz. By rewriting the programming languages and editing the scripts for my site. I again approached a method of copying someone's work. I learned step by step how to write a website. Allowed the site owner to copy its rules, which he copied from someone else. After a month of hard work, I launched my website with my own, although copied, design. Copying from others made me interested in graphics. And after 16 long years, I have set out to complete my bachelor's thesis. Even to my surprise in the field of Graphic and Media Design. Thanks for allowing us to copy. I would never be where I am today and could not do what I love.


We still learn by copying from each other. For example, copying help spread the message of founders and developers. 
Help not only young people but all newcomers in various fields. Most of us add our creative ideas after mastering the basic techniques. 
Copying helps us to define the meaning of life in the future phase of life.
